The "Languify" Language Detector Application is used to deduce what language some encoded script is written in. To achieve this, it uses a blackboard architecture involving three modules. The first is an input processor that converts images, PDFs, and general text inputs into a normalized UTF-8 plain text form. This is passed to the identifier service which uses insight from its three experts to interpret the language, and transfer the deduction to the subsequent display system. Based on this, the display system transforms the result into a comprehensive output complete with fun facts, a map of frequent speakers, and popular words and phrases from that language.

PDFs can be uploaded from the device's local storage, and photos can be taken from the device camera. See an example demonstration:
